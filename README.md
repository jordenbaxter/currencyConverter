# currencyConverter
This program converts CURR-A to CURR-B and inputs the result into the console.
This is my first Java program as well so I've not done stuff in the most efficient way and made some unneccesarry text files but IDC :D (okay, I'll fix it when I stop being lazy)
When you first launch this program, it will ask you for an API key. This API key can be obtained from https://free.currconv.com. Enjoy!
